# 01 — Getting your eBay API keys

You already sell on eBay. To let this toolkit pull prices and create listings
for you, eBay needs to know the requests are coming from an approved "app" tied
to your account. This is free. Budget ~15–20 minutes.

You do **not** need any of this just to catalog cards and generate drafts —
only for `get_comps.py` (pricing) and `create_listings.py live` (listing).

---

## Step 1 — Create a developer account

1. Go to **https://developer.ebay.com** and click **Register** (top right).
2. Sign in with the **same eBay account you sell with**, or create a developer
   login linked to it.
3. Accept the API License Agreement.

## Step 2 — Get your application keys

1. In the developer portal, open **Application Keysets** (under your account /
   "Your account" → "Application keysets").
2. You'll see two rows: **Sandbox** and **Production**.
   - **Sandbox** = a fake practice eBay for testing. Use this first.
   - **Production** = the real eBay.
3. For the **Sandbox** row, copy these three values into your `.env` file:
   - **App ID (Client ID)**   → `EBAY_APP_ID`
   - **Cert ID (Client Secret)** → `EBAY_CERT_ID`
   - **Dev ID**               → `EBAY_DEV_ID`
4. Make sure `.env` has `EBAY_ENV=sandbox` while testing.

Your `.env` now looks like:
```
EBAY_ENV=sandbox
EBAY_APP_ID=YourName-cardapp-SBX-abc123...
EBAY_CERT_ID=SBX-abc123...
EBAY_DEV_ID=1111-2222-3333...
```

### Test it
```bash
python3 get_comps.py
```
If your keys are right, it will pull prices. (In sandbox there's little real
data, so counts may be low — that's expected. Real data comes in production.)

---

## Step 3 — Let the app act on YOUR account (the "user token", only needed to LIST)

Pulling public prices only needs the keys above. **Creating listings** needs a
one-time **user token** that proves you gave the app permission to list on your
behalf. You do this once; it lasts a long time.

You do the login in your browser on eBay's site — nobody sees your password.
At the end eBay hands you a **Refresh Token** (a long string), which is the
thing you save.

### The easy way (recommended)

```bash
python3 get_user_token.py
```
(or **menu option 10**.) It prints a sign-in link, you click Agree on eBay, you
paste the address of the page it sends you back to, and it hands you the
refresh token. Skip to **"Where to put it"** below.

> ⚠️ **Don't use the "Get a User Token Here" button on eBay's developer site.**
> It looks like the right thing but only gives you a 2-hour **access** token,
> which stops working the same afternoon. The long-lasting **refresh** token
> only comes from the sign-in link the script prints.

### The manual way (if the script won't run)

1. Go to **https://developer.ebay.com**, sign in, open your **Production**
   application keyset, and find the **User Tokens** area
   ("Get a User Token" / "User access tokens").
2. **One-time setup — a redirect URL (RuName).** The first time, eBay asks for
   a "redirect URL name." Click **Add eBay Redirect URL**, give it any display
   title (e.g. "Card Vault"), and for the URLs you can use your GitHub Pages
   site (`https://mcdermottj639.github.io/Ebay/`) as both the privacy-policy and
   the accepted URL. Save it. (This is just a formality so eBay knows where to
   send you back; you only set it up once.)
3. Click the button to **get a token** / **sign in**. When it asks which
   permissions (scopes), choose **sell.inventory** (and **sell.account** if
   offered — that lets us read your shipping/return policies for Step 4).
4. Sign in as **the eBay account you sell from** and click **Agree**.
5. eBay shows you a **User access token** and a **Refresh Token**. Copy the
   **Refresh Token** — that's the one that lasts.

**Where to put it — important:** this is a secret, like your other keys.

> ⚠️ **Wrap it in double quotes.** The token contains `#` characters, and in a
> `.env` file or an environment setting a bare `#` starts a comment — so
> everything after the first one gets thrown away and you're left with a
> useless 5-character stub. This has bitten us once already (Aug 2026): the
> saved token was silently cut down to `v^1.1`, and eBay's error message
> ("issued to another client") pointed at completely the wrong problem.

- If you run the tools on your own computer, paste it into your local `.env`,
  in quotes:
  ```
  EBAY_USER_REFRESH_TOKEN="v^1.1#i^1#..."
  ```
- If Claude runs things in the cloud for you (the weekly auto-price, etc.),
  add it as an **environment variable** in your **Claude Code environment
  settings** — the same place you added `EBAY_APP_ID` / `EBAY_CERT_ID` /
  `EBAY_ENV`. Name it `EBAY_USER_REFRESH_TOKEN`, and quote the value the same
  way: `"v^1.1#i^1#..."`.

**Never paste the token into a chat message, a commit, or an email.** Put it in
`.env` or the environment settings only.

### Test it
```bash
python3 check_ebay_login.py
```
(or **menu option 9**). It doesn't list anything — it just tells you ✅ if the
connection works, or ❌ with a plain reason if something's off.

## Step 4 — Business policy IDs (only needed to LIST)

New-style eBay listings reference your saved **business policies** (how you
ship, get paid, handle returns).

1. In **Seller Hub → Account → Business Policies**, create a Shipping, a
   Payment, and a Return policy if you don't have them.
2. Get their IDs (via the developer portal's **Account API**, or ask Claude to
   fetch them for you once your keys work) and paste into `.env`:
   ```
   EBAY_FULFILLMENT_POLICY_ID=...
   EBAY_PAYMENT_POLICY_ID=...
   EBAY_RETURN_POLICY_ID=...
   EBAY_MERCHANT_LOCATION_KEY=...
   ```
> Tip: once your keys work, just tell Claude "fetch my eBay business policy IDs
> and put them in my .env" — the Account API call can be scripted.

---

## Step 5 — Go to production (when ready for real listings)

1. eBay may require you to **apply for production access** for the Sell APIs.
   Fill out the compliance form in the developer portal. Approval can take a
   few days.
2. Once approved, copy your **Production** keyset values into `.env` and change:
   ```
   EBAY_ENV=production
   ```
3. Redo the user-token step (Step 3) in production.

---

## Safety reminders

- Your `.env` file holds secrets. It's already in `.gitignore`, so it will
  **not** be uploaded to GitHub. Never paste its contents into a chat or email.
- Start in **sandbox**. Only switch to production when you've previewed
  listings and they look right.
- `create_listings.py` is dry-run unless you type `live`. It won't surprise you.
